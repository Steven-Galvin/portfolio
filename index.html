            <p>If you are curious to get to know me, I should warn you that I am a man of many interests. To save some time, I will narrow it down to my top three hobbies in order:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><span class="hobbie">Video Games</span>
                <p>Nothing tops winding down after a long day with some good old fashioned video game escapism.</p>
              </li>
              <li><span class="hobbie">Learning About Philosophy</span>
                <p>I am very interested in the subject of Philosophy. Thinking big and challenging what I think I know is very stimulating and helps clear my head.</p>
              </li>
              <li><span class="hobbie">Listening to and Studying Music</span>
                <p>Who doesn't enjoy tuning out the world by throwing some headphones on and blasting their favorite music. While I love purely listening to music, I love studying the finer details of it even more.</p>

          <p>Hi there! My name is <strong>Steven Galvin</strong> and I am a software developing student from Epicodus. I am very new to the field and this is my first major creation coming from the four weeks I've been learning, but hopefully this successfully shows off my skills. I got into web design about two years ago when I stumbled across Team Treehouse and their online courses. I was dabbling in it for awhile until I finally decided to pursue it head on with a physical school. I found out about Epicocus and applied right away. While I've only recently begun my schooling, I've been fond of web design since my freshamn year of High School back in 2009. I took an Intro to Web Design class and had a blast watching as I turned a blank page into a fully functional website. I graduated from David Douglas High School in 2012 and since then I have taken a few music classes at Clackams Community College and an Algebra class at Portland Community College. I worked as a newspaper carrier from 2012 to 2015 with the Oregonian until I got a job at Best Buy from October of 2015 to May of 2016. During the summer I worked as a construction laborer in North Dakota before coming back home to Portland and getting hired on as a Baker at Costco in the fall. I hope to further advance and refine my skills in this field so I can get out of Costco and into doing something I am passionate about.</p>

          <h1>Other Works</h1>
          <p>Here is a short list of my projects from <span class="order">newest</span> to <span class="order">oldest</span>. (<span id="notice">All links are to my <strong>Github repositories</strong> for you to access and clone the code.</span>)</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h4><a href="https://github.com/Steven-Galvin/wikipedia" target="_blank">Wikipedia Recreate</a></h4>
              <p class="indent">This is my latest project. A showcase of all I have learned so far at Epicodus. My partner, Emily Dokken, and I were tasked with recreating the Wikipedia homepage using what we knew of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. While not a perfect recreation, it is a good example of our understanding on how to create and style a basic website.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4><a href="https://github.com/Steven-Galvin/vacation" target="_blank">Vacation</a></h4>
              <p class="indent">This was a project made to practice my skills with Bootstrap. It is unfinished as of now, but it shows that I understand the basics of styling with Bootstrap by using containers, rows, wells, and more to create webpage detailing my dream vacation.</p>
              </li>
            <li>
              <h4><a href="https://github.com/Steven-Galvin/animal-shelter" target="_blank">Animal Shelter</a></h4>
              <p class="indent">To display our knowledge of the box model, this project was made by Arianna Chau and I. It is a fictional animal shelter page housing four cute animals that need rescuing. We used floats and the box model to create this simple and easy to view webpage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4><a href="https://github.com/Steven-Galvin/dogblog" target="_blank">Dogblog</a></h4>
              <p class="indent">One of my earlier projects. The purpose of this project was to practice basic HTML tags with the introduction of images. It's clearly a beginners page, but it's a good example of how far I've come within four short weeks.</p>
