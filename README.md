# Steven Galvin's Portfolio

#### This is my online portfolio for web design. 01/27/2017

#### By Steven Galvin

## Description

Just a very simple web design portfolio. It is designed to be an easy to read way to get to know a little about me and see some of my past work. It's very basic right now as I am only a beginner, but it will improve as I learn and develop more advanced skills in web design. Fairly simple to navigate as I only have an About Me section, four links to other works with a small description of each, and a contact section with links to my Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram as well as a hyperlink to send me an email.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Setup is easy. All you need is:
* A working computer or laptop with access to the internet.
* Your text editor of choice if you want to open up and play with my code.
* Latest versions of Google Chrome or Safari recommended as those are what I tested on.

## Known Bugs

No known bugs as of yet.
